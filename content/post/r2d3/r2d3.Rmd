# Purpose

D3 is a popular Javascript library for visualizations. It can also be used to select and change node elements in a webpage. Additionally, there is an R package, [R2D3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/) that allows for D3 code to be run easily in Shiny.

This workflow was adapted from an `HTML` implementation of D3 on an old website I made. I wanted to reuse some of the code because I like the effect that it makes and adapt it to run in `R` and `Shiny`.

### Load Libraries

```{r message=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(r2d3)
```

### Create Simple Shiny App

**Note that Shiny doesn't run in static R markdown documents!** We are just using shiny as a way to generate HTML code, hence no server function. The D3 code then interacts as javascript the rendered HTML page and we can see the effects. 
\ The JS code is captured in a separate script that is shown below.

```{r}
fluidPage(
  r2d3(script = "d3.js", height = 0),# important to set the height of the D3 script
  tags$div(style = "background-color: red; height: 200px",
           id = "one",
           "Initial Div"),
  tags$div(style = "height: 0px; opacity: 0; background-color: lightblue",
           id = "two",
           "Next Div"),
  actionButton("btn-one", "Change Div", class = "btn"),
  actionButton("btn-two", "Change Div Back")
)
```
While the same effect could be achieved with jquery or plain JS it was fun to come up with a usage for D3 that integrates into R Markdown so well.

Contents of `d3.js`
```{d3}
// define height of original div
var h = d3.select("#one").node().getBoundingClientRect().height;
var trans = 1000; // define transition time

// select first div element and make it disappear
d3.select('#btn-one').on("click", () => {
		d3.select('#one').transition().
		duration(trans).
		style("height", 0 + 'px')
		.style("opacity", 0);
		
// Select other div and replace 
		d3.select('#two').
		transition().
		duration(trans).
		style("height", h + 'px').
		style("opacity", 1);
});

// repeat same operation in reverse order
d3.select('#btn-two').on("click", () => {
		d3.select('#one').
		transition().
		duration(trans).
		style("height", h + 'px')
		.style("opacity", 1);
		
		d3.select('#two').
		transition().
		duration(trans).
		style("height", 0 + 'px').
		style("opacity", 0);
});
```
